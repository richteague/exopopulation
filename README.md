# exopopulation

Some scripts to make animated figures to show the population of detected exoplanets.

* `get_exoplanets.py` - Use this script to scrape the [Open Exoplanet Catalogue](https://github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/open_exoplanet_catalogue/) and find all exoplanets with a recorded mass and semi-major axis. This script can be easily modified to return any of the parameters you want.

* `plotting.py` - Some simple Python classes to aid in the animating of the figure.

* `plotting_animation.ipynb` - A Jupyter Notebook with a basic run.
